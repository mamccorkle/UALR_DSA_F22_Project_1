## CPSC 2380 Project 1 Topics:

> Doubly Linked List

#### Instructions:

> 1. (30 Points) Write a method void drawDoublyLinkedList() that draws a pictorial view of a doubly linked list. For example, if you run the following main.cpp, you should produce the output below.
> 2. (30 Points) Write a method bool isPalindrome() that returns true if a doubly linked list of integers is a palindrome or not. An empty doubly linked list of integers is a palindrome. You are NOT allowed to use any “reverse” method. Please use the following main.cpp to test the method for correctness.
> 3. (40 Points) Write a method, void split(n), that evenly splits a doubly linked list into n (n ≥ 1) doubly sub linked lists. If n is less than 1, exceeds the size of the doubly linked list, or the list cannot be evenly divided, print “cannot be processed.” to the output. Please use the following main.cpp to test the method for correctness.

> Your project will be graded based on the correctness of the program. In addition, the readability of the program will also be taken into account. To make the program readable, you should have a program header placed on the top of the program describing your name, student ID, and a brief description of what the program is going to in one or two sentences. Your program should be modular and lots of comments in the program.
